# Enhancing-Detection-of-Labor-Violations
This repository contains the data used for "Enhancing Detection of Labor Violations in the Agricultural Sector: A Multilevel Generalized Linear Regression Model of H-2A Violation Counts" paper.

In this study, we utilized multiple data sets to investigate the factors correlating with H-2A violations as identified by the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division. The primary data set includes information on H-2A violations, alongside state and industry-level factors. By combining these data sets, we were able to identify key factors that can guide inspection agencies in prioritizing their resources to more effectively inspect agricultural workplaces and improve conditions for H-2A workers.

Here are two data sets for analysis. The first dataset, "data_beforeScaling.csv", contains the raw data frame with all the predictors before any scaling was applied. Given the different scales of the predictors, we performed scaling to standardize the values, resulting in the second dataset, "data_afterScaling.csv". This scaled dataset was used for further analysis, allowing for more accurate and meaningful comparisons across the various predictors.
