# Enhancing-Detection-of-Labor-Violations
This repository contains the data used for "Enhancing Detection of Labor Violations in the Agricultural Sector: A Multilevel Generalized Linear Regression Model of H-2A Violation Counts" paper.

In this study, we utilized multiple data sets to investigate the factors correlating with H-2A violations as identified by the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division. The primary data set includes information on H-2A violations, alongside state and industry-level factors. By combining these data sets, we were able to identify key factors that can guide inspection agencies in prioritizing their resources to more effectively inspect agricultural workplaces and improve conditions for H-2A workers.
