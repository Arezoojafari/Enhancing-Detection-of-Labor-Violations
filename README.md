# Enhancing-Detection-of-Labor-Violations
This repository contains the data used for "Enhancing Detection of Labor Violations in the Agricultural Sector: A Multilevel Generalized Linear Regression Model of H-2A Violation Counts" paper.

In this study, we utilized multiple data sets to investigate the factors correlating with H-2A violations as identified by the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division. The primary data set includes information on H-2A violations, alongside state and industry-level factors. By combining these data sets, we were able to identify key factors that can guide inspection agencies in prioritizing their resources to more effectively inspect agricultural workplaces and improve conditions for H-2A workers.

Here are two data sets for analysis. The first dataset, "data_beforeScaling.csv", contains the raw data frame with all the predictors before any scaling was applied. Given the different scales of the predictors, we performed scaling to standardize the values, resulting in the second dataset, "data_afterScaling.csv". This scaled dataset was used for further analysis, allowing for more accurate and meaningful comparisons across the various predictors.

For feature scaling, we utilized the Robust Scaler from the Sklearn package to standardize the predictor variables. This method is particularly effective in handling outliers in the data. Additionally, we used a correlation matrix to determine the correlations between predictors and the target variable. This approach helps to explore the data, identify correlations, and discover independent factors.

For feature selection, we applied Pearson correlation analysis to identify the strongest correlations between predictors and the target variable. We also used the feature importance provided by the random forest regression model to assess the significance of each predictor. In this stage, we focused on dividing the data into a training set and a test set to evaluate the performance of our model. To achieve this, we imported the train_test_split function from the sklearn library. This process allowed us to allocate a portion of the data for training the model while reserving the remaining data for testing its performance.Additionally, we used the feature importance provided by the random forest regression model to assess the significance of each predictor. 

Moreover, we employed recursive feature elimination with k-fold cross-validation to systematically select the most influential factors for our model.In this stage, we imported the RFECV function from sklearn's feature_selection module for recursive feature elimination with k-fold cross-validation. This powerful tool enabled us to optimize the feature selection process for our model.

Based on the results of feature importances from the RandomForestRegressor and the RFECV analysis, we discovered that the number of farms has correlation with other facotrs in our model. This finding indicated that it would be appropriate to remove the number of farms as a predictor variable.
